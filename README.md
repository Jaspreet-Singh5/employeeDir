## Design Decisions

### 1. Frontend Framework and Stack
- **Angular Material** is used for UI components to ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and a consistent look and feel.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used alongside Angular Material for utility-first, rapid, and customizable styling.

### 2. Component Structure
- The application is organized into reusable components, such as `SearchPanelComponent` for searching and `DataTableComponent` for displaying employee data.
- Components communicate via input/output bindings, keeping logic modular and maintainable.

### 3. Data Modeling and Storage
- **Employee data** is stored in a local JSON file (`employee-data.json`) for simplicity and ease of development/testing. This can be replaced with an API in the future.
- **Positions** are modeled as an array of objects with `id` and `value` pairs, allowing for unique identification and future extensibility (e.g., adding descriptions or localization).
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** are used to define and enforce the structure of employee data throughout the app.

### 4. Type Safety and Linting
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled for safer, more predictable code.
- ESLint and Angular ESLint are used to enforce code quality and style consistency.

### 5. Build and Tooling
- Configuration files are set up for Prettier and EditorConfig to maintain consistent code formatting across the team.
